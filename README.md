# Federated-Learning-IDS

## Summary
- Analyse the effectiveness of federated learning models in serving as intrusion detection systems. 
- Investigates how non iid distributions, data/model poisoning attacks, membership inference attacks affects the model. 
- Proposes and evaluated various defense techniques against these attacks. 



## Files
**federated_learning**
- Compares the performance of local client, federated client, federated server and central server. 
- Expirically evaluates the effect of non iid data distribution, label flipping, adversarial inputs, and gradient manipulations on the overall performance of the model. 
- Implements an RL based dynamically adapting weighting system to handle non iid data distribution, differential privacy and adversarial training to protect from various attacks.
